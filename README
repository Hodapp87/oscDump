This is a Processing sketch I put together for my own use. What it does is
monitor the specified port for OSC (Open Sound Control) messages and then
output the address pattern and all the arguments.
Clicking the tiny window also sends out an example message.

At the moment it does not support all types of arguments.

This is based on oscP5parsing from the oscP5 examples.
