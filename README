This is a Processing sketch I put together for my own use. What it does is
monitor the specified port for OSC (Open Sound Control) messages and then
output the address pattern and all the arguments, along with creating a
table of which messages it's seen (and how many times).

The dump of the address pattern and arguments occurs in the Processing
console. The display of the address patterns and how many times each has
been seen is shown in the graphical Processing window.

Clicking in the window also sends out an example message. If you're set to
broadcast on the same port on which you listen, you should see the message.

At the moment it does not support all types of arguments. That's a work in
progress.

This is based on oscP5parsing from the oscP5 examples.
